Magento Mimi
============

A responsive Magento theme built off the RWD package. I am using Magento Community Edition 1.9 but this theme can be used for both Enterprise and Community.

This repo only contains the /app/design/ and /skin/ folders.

There are two branches, a master branch and a development branch. The master branch will always hold a production-ready version while the dev branch is for developing only.

Feel free to download this and poke around the template files.
